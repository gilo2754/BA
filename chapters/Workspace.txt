-Features in Billing and Cost Management
The Billing and Cost Management service provides features that you can use to do the following:

Estimate and plan your AWS costs

Receive alerts if your costs exceed a threshold that you set

Assess your biggest investments in AWS resources

Simplify your accounting if you work with multiple AWS accounts


-Analyzing Costs with Cost Explorer
The AWS Billing and Cost Management console includes the no-cost Cost Explorer tool for viewing your AWS cost data as a graph. With Cost Explorer, you can filter graphs by values such as API operation, Availability Zone, AWS service, custom cost allocation tag, Amazon EC2 instance type, purchase option, AWS Region, usage type, usage type group, and more. If you use consolidated billing, you can also filter by member account. In addition, you can see a forecast of future costs based on your historical cost data.

-AWS Budgets
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/budgets-managing-costs.html
You can use AWS Budgets to track your AWS usage and costs. Budgets use the cost visualization provided by Cost Explorer to show you the status of your budgets. This provides forecasts of your estimated costs and tracks your AWS usage, including your free tier usage. You can also use budgets to create Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notifications that tell you when you go over your budgeted amounts, or when your estimated costs exceed your budgets.
